            <p class="Introduction">Situated right next to River Tejo, Lisbon is where you fall in love with nature, fresh food and lovely weather. If you are looking for a location where it won't be packed with tourists during the Summer, come to Lisbon,
                Portugal. This city is packed with history, crazy nightlife from all different cultures and relaxing locations.

            <h2>MUST VISIT</h2>

            <button type="button" name="button" id="button1">Click the box to find out the five top places you <b>must</b> visit in Lisbon.</button>

            <section id="mustvisit">

                <h3>Pasteis de Belem</h3>
                <p>If you love pastries then you must go to Belém and order a box of six “pasteis de belem”. This location has been open since 1837 and the taste never changes. Located right next to a Starbucks and a park, you may grab your coffee and have a
                    picnic with your friends, family or loved one
                </p>

                <h3>Bairro Alto</h3>
                <p>Lisbon's nightlife cannot be compared to any other around the world. One of the greatest things about Lisbon is how cheap everything is compared to other cities in Europe. In Bairro Alto you will find the biggest variety of bars from latin
                    music to reggae to kizomba to hip-hop. Bairro Alto is the only place where you will find a 1 euro beer in a large size. Best spot to go bar hopping at night.
                </p>

                <h3>Rossio</h3>
                <p>Located right in the center of Lisbon, Rossio is right next to Chiado and Praça da Republica where you will find lots and lots of restaurants for cheap prices but amazing quality. Chiado also has a lot of stores such as Zara, Adidas,
                    Bershka
                    and more. If you like to buy luxury (Louis Vuitton, Max Mara and Versace) then Praça da Republica is for you.
                </p>

                <h3>Costa da Caparica
                </h3>

                <p>Although the beach water in Lisbon is really cold, if you like to surf Costa da Caparica is your destination. With several restaurants close to the beach, in order to get there you must go through the bridge 25 de Abril famously known for
                    being similar to the San Francisco bridge.
                </p>

                <h3>Centro Comercial Colombo
                </h3>

                <p>Usually when you go on vacation, malls are not a top priority. But Centro Comercial Colombo is a mall where you can find any store you need from anything you would like. You can get a tattoo or piercings, shop for your wedding and go to a
                    pharmacy all in the same location. One of their main attractions is the food court and the bowling alley/bar right next to the movie theater.

            <ul>
                <li>If you speak Spanish then you will be more than fine because Portuguese people will understand you and speak “Portunhol” with you. (A mix of portuguese with spanish)
                </li>
                <li>Ubering is better than taking taxis because the taxis will make sure they take a longer way to make more money. Trust me, Uber is cheaper
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>Have fun and a safe trip!</p>
